            <p>In the era of programming, <strong>Git </strong>is quite popular among developers. So, In this blog We’ll
              try understand the concept of Git and why it’s gaining so much of popularity.</p>



            <p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong></p>



            <h4>What is Version Control?</h4>



            <p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can
              recall specific versions later. So, we can place any file in the computer on version control. </p>



            <p><strong>Git </strong>is a Version Control System created by <em>Linus Torvalds</em> you know the guy who
              has created Linux kernel. Now, Why he created another technology called <em>Git</em>. So, What happens you
              know, when you talk about Linux kernel it’s Open-source and anyone can contribute. So, if you living in
              any way in the world you can contribute to the Linux kernel. Now, what you can do, you can download the
              copy of the Linux kernel and you can add your features and you can submit it there. By the way, they will
              not accept your request by default, but you have to provide some new features. The important thing is you
              can be a contributor of Linux kernel. So, In this world we have millions of programmers if everyone is
              trying to work on one software how they can manage it. Is is that easy to manage? No, It’s damn difficult,
              trust me. Even if you have five people working on a project it will be difficult for you to manage that
              project. So, What he came up with the concept called Git. So, It handles merging of different source code
              form different people and maintaining versions so those things are provided by Git. </p>



            <h4>Distributed Version Control vs Centralized Version Control</h4>





            <p>Before<strong> Distributed Version Control System</strong>, developers were worked with Centralized
              Version Control System (Subversion). Let’s talk about <strong><em>Centralized Version Control
                  (subversion)</em></strong> you will be having multiple computers or maybe you will be having one
              computer and you will be having one server so all your versions will be stored on this server. Now, let’s
              talk about the drawback of this, you have a working copy that is perfectly fine but the versions are
              maintained in the server. What if this server fails, what if you lose all your data from server it may
              happen right? What if you are travelling somewhere and you don’t have an internet connection or maybe you
              are somewhere in a remote place where you don’t have an internet connection. How can you get this
              <strong>repository </strong>that’s new term right? A repository is a place where you will have your source
              code or you can imagine a foreground server. If there is no internet connection there will be an issue and
              there is a single point of failure. If this fails you lose everything so what if you have multiple
              machines normally what happens if you are working for a company every computer every project data will be
              stored on one server what if everyone can have their copy. So we can create a copy of itself so we will be
              having a working copy and we will having something called a&nbsp;<strong>Local Repository</strong>. </p>



            <p> So, this is your local repository on the server and we will be having a remote repository. Now, the
              advantage you have is even if your server fails that’s fine you have a local repository on your system and
              you can mirror your local copy to the server next time if your server fails now this time what we are
              doing is every machine or every developer has their copy so this is called as&nbsp;<strong>Distributed
                version control system</strong>.&nbsp;So, we are distributing the repository so every machine will have
              their own local repository now even if you’re in flight or maybe if you’re in some remote place if you
              don’t have an internet connection that’s fine you can work on your project and you can create different
              versions in your local repository and when you connected to the internet just push it on the server that
              will be awesome and that’s your&nbsp;<strong>Distributed version control system</strong>.</p>



            <p> But the question-arises, how will you implement all these things, we can create our local copy, so we
              can download git for free first of all it’s free and open-source or you can download the git from the
              internet. If you are using<strong> MAC OS</strong> you already have git there but if you’re
              <strong><em>Linux </em></strong>you can install as you normally install other software’s we’re using the
              <em>package manager</em> or if you are using <strong><em>Windows</em></strong>, we have&nbsp;<strong>git
                bash.&nbsp;</strong>But question-aries how will you get the remote version can I create my own remote
              repository that is possible right you can buy your server you can add your git service but do we have to
              really buy those services we don’t have to actually we have two different webs, in fact, we have multiple
              implementations one of them is&nbsp;<strong>GitHub</strong>, <strong>GitLab </strong>or we can
              use&nbsp;<strong>Bitbucket</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We also have some UI tools to work with them as
              we have&nbsp;<strong>SourceTree.</strong> </p>



            <h4><strong>Git Workflow</strong></h4>



            <p>Before, we start working with Git commands, it is necessary that you understand what it represents.</p>



            <h4><strong>What is a Repository?</strong></h4>



            <p>A <strong>repository </strong>a.k.a <strong>repo </strong>is nothing but a collection of source code.</p>



            <h4>There are four fundamental elements in the Git Workflow.</h4>



            <p>Working Directory, Staging Area, Local Repository and Remote Repository.</p>

            <p>Let’s understand the Git Workflow in more detail.</p>



            <h4>The Working Tree</h4>
