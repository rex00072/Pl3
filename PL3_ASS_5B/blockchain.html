					<h3>What is Blockchain? </h3>

					<p>
						If this technology is so complex, why call it “blockchain?” At its most basic level, blockchain
						is literally just a chain of blocks, but not in the traditional sense of those words. When we
						say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital
						information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”).
					</p>

						<h3>Why do I need to know about Blockchain?</h3>


						<p>There are three reasons why you need to know about Blockchain:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Blockchain technology <b>doesn't have to exist publicly</b>. It can also exist privately
								- where <b>nodes </b>are simply points in a private network and the Blockchain acts
								similarly to a distributed ledger. Financial institutions specifically are under
								tremendous pressure to demonstrate regulatory compliance and many are now moving ahead
								with Blockchain implementations. Secure solutions like Blockchain can be a crucial
								building block to reduce compliance costs.</li>
							<li>Block-chain technology is <b>broader than finance</b>. It can be applied to any
								multi-step transaction where traceability and visibility is required. <b>Supply
									chain</b> is a notable use case where Blockchain can be leveraged to manage and sign
								contracts and audit product provenance. It could also be leveraged for <b>votation
								</b>platforms, titles and deed management - amongst myriad other uses. As the digital
								and physical worlds converge, the practical applications of Blockchain will only grow.
							</li>
							<li>The exponential and disruptive growth of Blockchain will come from the <b>convergence
								</b>of public and private Blockchains to an ecosystem where firms, customers and
								suppliers can collaborate in a secure, auditable and virtual way.<br>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>We hope that helps in your Blockchain conversations - happy mining!</p>
